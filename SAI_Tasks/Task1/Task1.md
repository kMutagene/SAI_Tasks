## Task 1 - Define in your own words  

- **Intelligence** is the ability to solve new problems by usage of existing knowledge. This requires the ability to aquire and store knowledge and its application.
- **Artificial Intelligence** is the attempt to mimic intelligence in systems created by humans.
- **Knowledge** is stored and accessible data
- **Learning** is the aquisition of new knowledge

## Task 2 - Intelligence quotient  

An IQ test only captures the ability to solve specific problems defined by the test. The performance in this test only scores the ability to solve these given tasks, therefore the high score of the compuiter program only tells us that this program is better at solving IQ tests than humans. Intelligence is not strictly defined. If our definition in Task 1 is used, this does not necessarily mean that the computer is more intelligent than a human because IQ test generally dont capture every scenario for which this definition is applicable.

## Task 3
