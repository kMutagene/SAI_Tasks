## Task 4 -
The following map is given. Paths are bidirectional
![Task4](pics/Task4.png)

a) Use the A* search algorithm to find the lowest-cost route from node A to J,
with traversal costs on the map as actual cost and euclidean distance for
estimated remaining cost. Create a search tree in the following notation:
    ![Task4.2](pics/Task4.2.png)

    B marks the node. (1) is the sequence number. Numbers from top to bottom are: traversal cost up to this point, estimated remaining cost, combined cost.
    When you reach a node that is already in the tree and it is not cheaper to
    reach now, mark this new node with × in place of a sequence number and
    ignroe it.

b) Give the optimal path from A to J with total traversal cost.
